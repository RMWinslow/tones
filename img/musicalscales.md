This [virtual piano](https://virtualpiano.net/) is the best I've found. Sadly, though it uses shift to hit the black keys. And 

Standard equal tempermant scale has each note go up by $2^{1/12}$

[Pythagorean Tuning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_tuning) constructs the ratios from pure perfect fifths (3:2) and octaves (2:1).

If you have a note and the other notes with frequency $n$ times as fast, the lowest note, will be percived as the actual note being played, and the higher overtones will change the timbre.
> In music, the [fundamental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_frequency) is the musical pitch of a note that is perceived as the lowest partial present. In terms of a superposition of sinusoids, the fundamental frequency is the lowest frequency sinusoidal in the sum.

> Since the fundamental is the lowest frequency and is also perceived as the loudest, the ear identifies it as the specific pitch of the musical tone [harmonic spectrum].... The individual partials are not heard separately but are blended together by the ear into a single tone.


I could set things up using columns instead of rows. And have each column be a [tetrachord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrachord)


What I've been trying to do is [Additive Synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_synthesis) 


From the 12 tones equal temperment, we can tweak to get just tunings:
- C = 0 up, baseline
- 💿 = 1 up $\approx$ 16/15 (Just diatonic semitone)
- D = 2 up $\approx$ 9/8 (Major Tone)
- 🇩🇪 = 3 up $\approx$ 6/5 (just minor third)
- E = 4 up $\approx$ 5/4 (Just major third)
- F = 5 up $\approx$ 4/3 (Just perfect fourth)
- 🐸 = 6 up $\approx$ 45/32 (Just augmented fourth) or  $\approx$ 64/45 (Just diminished 5th)
- G = 7 up $\approx$ 3/2 = $\frac{4}{3}\frac{9}{8}$ (just perfect fifth)
- 🇬🇦 = 8 up $\approx$ 8/5 (Just minor sixth)
- A = 9 up $\approx$ 5/3 = $\frac{4}{3}\frac{5}{4}$ or 27/16 (Just major sixth)
- 🆎 = 10 up $\approx$ 7/4 (Harmonic seventh)
- B = 11 up $\approx$ 15/8  = $\frac{4}{3}\frac{5}{4}$ (just major seventh)



Major tone is 9:8. Minor tone is 10:9.  
Just diatonic semitone is 16:15

In [Five-limit tuning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-limit_tuning),
a power of 2 moves up an octave, 
a power of 3 moves up an octave and a perfect fifth, and 
a power of 5 moves up two octaves plus a major third.

Pretty close to what I was trying to do.

Maybe should use 7 limit tuning



Possibilities for note between F and G
- 64/45 = 4/3 * 16/15
